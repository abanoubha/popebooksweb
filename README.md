# Pope Books for Web

A web user interface for the books of Pope Shenouda III.

## Why ?

I created this web UI project to facilitate adding, editing, and proofreading the books.

## Wanna read Pope's books ?

Download the app on your Android phone from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softwarepharaoh.popebooks)! (books are in Arabic)

## vision

- include all pope's books
- include all pope's published articles
- include all poems
- (re)compose them as technical components such as H1, P, UL, OL, IMG, .. then scroll vertically as it is more familiar for people nowadays.
- convert each separate topic into (nested/interlinked) infographic(s) using Gemini Nano Banana Pro (AI/LLM)
